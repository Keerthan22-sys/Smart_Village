# Smart_Village
 A Computer Graphics mini project, I have created some artifacts in this mini project, like a home, sun, clouds, trees, and birds. In the project a house is present in a small village and in the sky couple of clouds will be passing in the sky and there will be few trees from where the set of birds will be flying from and in the house we can turn off the light and turn on the light whenever it is needed and it has got two modes in it day mode and the night mode the above-explained things are attained in the day mode and in the night mode an airplane and the comet will be passing in the night sky.
 
 # OpenGL Library
OpenGL is the industry’s most widely used and supported 2D and 3D graphics application programming interface (API), bringing thousands of applications to a wide variety of computer platforms. OpenGL fosters innovation and speeds application development by incorporating a broad set of rendering, texture mapping, special effects, and other powerful visualization functions.

# Software Requirements
